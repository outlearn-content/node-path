# Introduction

Greetings!  Welcome to JavaScript Backends with Node.js!

We have put together this learning path for people who are experienced software programmers but are new to Node.js as an environment and to JavaScript as a language for serious programming. It's relatively short and fast-paced, but an experienced programmer should have no trouble keeping up.

The path includes content from a variety of sources, all of which are openly licensed or for which I have received permission from the authors to republish their content here.  I have enhanced the content to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

We'll start with a Re-introduction to JavaScript for those who've been stuck in other languages for too long, and then we'll get right into the meat of Node.js server-side framework. At the end we'll give you an overview of where to learn more about several advanced topics in Node.js.

Good luck!
