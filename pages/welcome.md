# Introduction

Greetings!  Welcome to JavaScript Backends with Node.js!

I have put together this learning path for people who are experienced software programmers but are new to Node.js as an environment and to JavaScript as a language for serious programming. It's relatively short and fast-paced, but an experienced programmer should have no trouble keeping up.

The path includes content from  a variety of sources, all of which are openly licensed or for which I have received permission from the authors to republish their content here.  I have enhanced the content to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

We'll start with a Re-introduction to JavaScript for those who've been stuck in other languages for too long, and then we'll get right into the meat of Node.js server-side framework.

Good luck!

Bob Loblaw
